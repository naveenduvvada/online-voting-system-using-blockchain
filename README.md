# 🗳️ Online Voting System using Blockchain

A secure, transparent, and decentralized **online voting system** built using **Blockchain technology**.  
This project ensures **fair elections** by eliminating vote tampering, providing immutability, and ensuring voter anonymity.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🔐 **Secure Voting** – Each vote is encrypted and stored on the blockchain.  
- 📊 **Transparency** – Anyone can verify votes without revealing voter identity.  
- 👤 **Voter Authentication** – Prevents duplicate or fake votes using unique IDs.  
- ⛓️ **Blockchain-Powered** – Ensures immutability and decentralization of records.  
- 🖥️ **User-Friendly Interface** – Simple UI for voters and administrators.  
- 📈 **Real-time Results** – Votes are counted instantly with no manual intervention.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

User → Authentication → Cast Vote → Blockchain Network → Verify & Store Vote → Results

- **Frontend:** Web interface for voters and admin  
- **Backend:** Handles authentication, vote transactions, and blockchain interaction  
- **Blockchain:** Stores votes in a decentralized and immutable ledger  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React/Bootstrap optional)  
- **Backend:** Python (Flask/Django) or Node.js  
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum / Hyperledger / Solidity (Smart Contracts)  
- **Database (optional):** MongoDB / MySQL (for voter data)  
- **Tools:** Ganache, MetaMask, Truffle/Hardhat (for Ethereum development)
